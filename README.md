# Data Structures With Python

## Data Structures
Data Structures are a way of organizing data for effective and efficient usage. 

This repo is to practice and understand data structures and this repo will be home for data structure implementations such as such as Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees and their implementations in Python language.

## Types of Data Structures:
* Linear data structures such as Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists etc
* Non Linear data structures such as Trees and Graphs

## Arrays
An array is basically, a collection of (index, value) pairs, where the index will be starting from 0 or 1 based on programming language design. Arrays are usually stored in contigous locations in memory. Arrays contain homogenous elements.

In Python, There is no built in data type for Arrays, but **array** module and **numpy** library can be utilized for array computations.

## Linked List
